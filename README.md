At first I used other people's efi folders because I thought it would be difficult to create my own. But not. It is easier than you think. I am Spanish and I used google translator in the dotania guide. I have Mac OS running on my computer perfectly. Better than olarila / other people's efi folders.
Even so, I leave you my efi folder for you to enjoy it but it will always be better if you make one. Specs of my computer: i79700k msi 7390 a pro, rx560. Paypal: paypal.me/biskakatalunya
